## Description

**USES AND FUNCTIONS**
The Employee Tracker application is a command-line interface (CLI) content management system (CMS) designed to manage and maintain an employee database. It is built using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL, allowing users to interact seamlessly with their company's departments, roles, and employees.

**KEY USES:**
   1. Database Management: The application provides an easy way to view, add, and update employee information. It allows companies to track their organizational structure, including which employees belong to which department, their job roles, salaries, and who they report to.

   2. Department and Role Organization: By keeping departments and job roles up-to-date, users can manage the structure of the company, helping with budgeting, promotions, and role allocations within different departments.

   3. Employee Record Keeping: The Employee Tracker allows for centralized management of employee records, which is crucial for both small and large businesses to maintain accurate data.

**CORE FUNCTIONS:**

1. **View All Departments**
   - Lists all departments within the company.
   - Useful for obtaining an overview of how the company is structured by department.

2. **View All Roles:**
   - Displays all available job titles along with their associated salaries and departments.
   - This helps HR departments ensure that roles and salaries are correctly managed.

3. **View All Employees:**
   - Provides a complete list of employees along with their roles and managers.
   - This feature makes it easy to see reporting relationships and overall staffing.

4. **Add a Department:**
   - Allows the user to add a new department to the database.
   - Facilitates company growth by ensuring new departments are properly recorded and tracked.

5. **Add a Role:**
   - Enables the creation of new job roles, including title, salary, and department association.
   - This helps manage organizational changes and ensure every department has the necessary roles.

6. **Add an Employee:**
   - Adds new employees by prompting the user for first name, last name, role, and manager.
   - Ensures that employee records are always up-to-date with new hires.

7. **Update an Employee's Role:**
   - Updates an existing employee's job role to reflect promotions, transfers, or organizational restructuring.
   - This helps keep the database current and ensures accurate reflection of company hierarchy.

This application is designed to be a fast and efficient tool for managing employee records and company structure, allowing for better operational management and decision-making in real-time.

<a id="tests"></a>
## Tests
I ran this code in my terminal with node. Did have issues getting databases loaded. Was able to manually force the <emplyee_db> to load by running PostgreSQL in the command line and manually loading the seeds.sql and schema.sql files.

<a id="development"></a>
## Future Development
I'd like for it to loop smoothly and be more visually appealing. Also, would like to go through and simplify the code more. Additionally, I would like to be able to find a way to load the seeded databases without <psql -U postgres> then <\i schema.sql> and <\i seeds.sql>. This may have been an issue with my database on my local machine.
